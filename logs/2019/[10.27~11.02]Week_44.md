嗨，这是第44周。

# Welcome aboard 和 Welcome on board

aboard比on board出现得更早，当表示上船，上飞机，上火车等交通工具时，这两种说法可以互相替换使用。

* Jack was already aboard/on board when he remembered that he’d left his suit at home.
* The plane crashed, but everyone on board/aboard survived.
* Are all the passengers aboard/on board?
* This is your captain speaking. Welcome aboard/on board of this British Airways flight.

Welcome on board 和 Welcome aboard 都可以用来表达欢迎新成员来到团队。

* Welcome on board/aboard, James always speaks very highly of you.
* Welcome, Janine. It’s good to have you on board/aboard!
