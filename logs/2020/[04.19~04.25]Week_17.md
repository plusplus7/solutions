# D'oh

D'oh 是一个来自家庭幽默喜剧动画片《辛普森一家》中角色霍默的流行语。

通常霍默在不小心伤到自己或者意识到自己做了一件愚蠢的，不好的事，或者是即将发生在自己身上的事时，他便会使用这句话来叫喊或者感叹。

其他的家庭成员偶尔也会使用这句话。

"D'oh!" is a catchphrase used by the fictional character Homer Simpson, from the television series The Simpsons, an animated sitcom. It is an exclamation typically used after Homer injures himself, realizes that he has done something stupid, or when something bad has happened or is about to happen to him. All his prominent blood relations—son Bart, daughters Lisa and Maggie, his father, his mother and half-brother—have also been heard to use it themselves in similar circumstances. On a few occasions, Homer's wife Marge and characters outside the family such as Mr. Burns and Sideshow Bob have also used this phrase.
