# TLS 1.3 学习笔记

```
TLS protocol provides:
	• Authentication
	• Confidentiality
	• Integrity
TLS consists of 2 primary components:
	• A handshake protocol authenticates:
		○ Communicating parties
		○ Negotiates cryptographic modes/parameters
		○ Estashlishes shared keying material
		
	• A record protocol
		○ uses parameters established by handshake protocol
		○ Protect traffic between communicating peers

TLS 1.3 is not directly compatible with previous versions

TLS 1.3 supersedes and obsoletes:
	• Ticket mechanism => Resumption
	• Keying material exporters(PRF) => Exporters(HKDF)
	• Online Certificate Status Protocol
Differences from TLS 1.2:
	• All Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data
	      (AEAD) algorithms
	• Added 0-RTT
	• All public-key based key exchange mechanisms provide forward secrecy [Why Static RSA and Diffie-Hellman cipher suites removed in TLS 1.3]

TLS supports 3 key exchange modes:
	• (EC)DHE: finite fields or elliptic curves
	• PSK-only
	• PSK with (EC)DHE

In ClientHello, the client should offer 4 sets of options:
	• A list of cipher suites indicating AEAD algorithm/HKDF hash pairs
	• A supported_groups extension which indicates the (EC)DHE groups which client supports and a key_share extension which contains (EC)DHE shares for some or all of these groups.
	• A signature_algorithms that client can accept. Probably a signature_algorithms_cert may also be added.
A pre_shared_key extension
