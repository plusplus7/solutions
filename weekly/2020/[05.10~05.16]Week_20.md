# 为什么浏览器不检查DNS CAA

A set of CAA records describes only current grants of authority to issue certificates for the corresponding DNS domain.

Since a certificate is typically valid for at least a year, it is possible that a certificate that is not conformant with the CAA records currently published was conformant with the CAA records published at the time that the certificate was issued. 

Relying Applications MUST NOT use CAA records as part of certificate validation. [emphasis mine]
