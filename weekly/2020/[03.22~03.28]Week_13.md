嗨，这是第13周。

# [TIL] 保时捷在过去25年里生产的车，大约有97.4%仍然能在公路上驾驶

保时捷车主可能是仅有的会炫耀车辆驾驶里程数的豪华车车主。然而，法拉利车主在拥有一辆爱车时，有可能只会驾驶他的爱车几千英里。驾驶爱车超过20万英里对于保时捷车主很普遍。

当保养得当，保时捷通常也非常地可靠。所以拥有一辆保时捷的维护费用其实也并不是想象的那么高。

购买保时捷的费用通常会吓退大多数人。

最后再提一点，保时捷最初就是被设计为实用的车型。911作为最著名的一款车型，它拥有实用的储物箱，后排座椅，相较于其他跑车的而言，更具有舒适性，日常驾驶也非常简单。

保时捷可以作为工作日上班的代步车，也可以作为周末去赛道上撒欢的跑车。这也是为什么保时捷核心用户反感保时捷生产SUV的原因，他们觉得这是降低了品牌档次。

Porsches are probably the only upscale car brand where owners brag about how many miles the car has on it. Where a Ferrari owner might put a few thousand miles on a car the entire time they own it, it's common for Porsche owners to put well over 200,000 miles on them or more. They're also incredibly reliable when properly maintained, so cost of ownership isn't nearly as bad as you would think. It's the initial entry price that kills most people. And the last thing I'll note is that Porsches are designed to be practical. The 911 is the most well known Porsche and it has a useable trunk, a backseat, its comfortable (by sports car standards), and easy to drive at normal speeds. They really are designed to be cars that you drive to the office during the week and to the racetrack on weekends. That's why so many Porsche purists hate these SUVs that they've been building, they view them as watering down the brand.
