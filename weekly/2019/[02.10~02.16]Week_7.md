# [今日英语] Notwithstanding

在法律英语中的翻译与although， though， even if使用并没有太大区别，基本上都可以翻译成“尽管
, “即使…”，表示一种让步，但是它引导的并不是让步状语从句，而只是一个名词性短语。

例：

```
Notwithstanding subsection (3) a magistrate may require the police officer, usher or other officer who served a summons to attend before him and give evidence on oath as to its service.
尽管有第（3）的规定，裁判官仍可规定送达传票的警务人员、传达员或其他人员在他席前，就送达传票一事经宣誓而作证。
```

# [今日英语] Prezo

Short & informal for "Presentation," usually a public presentation or business speech using multi-media.

# [瑞典谚语] It fell between chairs

Someone had one area of responsibility, someone else had a neighbouring area of responsibility. The first person thought one particular issue belonged to the other area, and vice versa. Since it wasn’t clearly any single person’s responsibility, neither acted on it.

It is often used more loosely. If someone is given a task as a secondary objective, and has to spend all his time on his primary objective, the expression still applies—especially if the person delegating the secondary task doesn’t follow up on it until it is too late.

And sometimes it is used as a face-saving lie when someone just forgot.
