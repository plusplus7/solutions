Hi, this is week 21. And weather here in Suzhou is very good.

# Toblerone

Toblerone is a famous Swiss chocolate brand, which is unique because of the mountain-shaped chocolates and its logo.

Toblerone was created by Emil Baumann & Theodor Tobler in Bern, Switzerland in 1908.

The triangular shape of the Matterhorn in the Swiss Alps is commonly believed to have given Theodor Tobler his inspiration for the shape of Toblerone.

# Matterhorn

The Matterhorn has a pyramidal shape with four faces nearly facing the four compass points. The Matterhorn was one of the last of the main Alpine mountains to be ascended, not because of its technical difficulty, but because of the fear it inspired in early mountaineers.
